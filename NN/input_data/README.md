# sample data

30 samples of the legendre expanded power spectrum.

./dir{X} -> X:label of realization.

./dir{X}/Pk_m_RS{Y}_z={Z}.txt -> legendre expanded power spectrum at z=Z and the line of sight is axis=Y. Each column correspond to k, P_0(k), P_2(k), and P_4(k), respectively.

./dir{X}/z{Z}.dat -> the value of f\sigma_8 of realization X at z={Z}.
